# Fibonacci Algorithms

Types of Fibonacci codes in Python with their performance testing!

#

# Algorithms

### Recursive

Use The Recursive Function.
You can see [recursive.py](https://github.com/dori-dev/fibonacci-algorithms/blob/main/recursive.py) file to use and check this way.

## Cache

Use The Cache To Avoid Duplication of Processing.
You can see [cache.py](https://github.com/dori-dev/fibonacci-algorithms/blob/main/cache.py) file to use and check this way.

## Class

Use The Recursive Class.
You can see [class.py](https://github.com/dori-dev/fibonacci-algorithms/blob/main/class.py) file to use and check this way.

## Loop

Use The For Loop.
You can see [loop.py](https://github.com/dori-dev/fibonacci-algorithms/blob/main/loop.py) file to use and check this way.
